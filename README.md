# Infrastructure-and-GDP

In this project, I want to explore a simple question: Does infrastructure development correlate with economic development?

I use 3 datasets to carry out my analysis. All of them are collected and compiled by international non-profit organizations, such as the International Telecommunication Union, the World Bank, and the United Nations Statistics Division. Each of the datasets contains entries of information of a country at one year.

The first two datasets, “Percentage of individuals using the Internet” (referred to “Internet” for the sake as convenience) collected by the International Telecommunication Union and “Quality of port infrastructure” (referred to “Infrastructure” for the sake as convenience) collected by the World Bank, are two different measurements of “infrastructure” in the central question. The third dataset, “GDP per capita” (referred to “GDP” for the sake as convenience) collected by the United Nations Statistic Division, measures “economic development” in the central question.

My hypothesis is that “ infrastructure development positively correlates with economic development”, and I would do linear and non-linear analysis to explore their potential relationship. Additionally, I hypothesize that the subgroups of more developed countries would have a stronger and relationship between their quality of infrastructure and their GDP than the less developed countries.

My final results show that there is a positive non-linear relationship between the infrastructure development and economic development.
